# RPC Protocol

## Serialization

The protocol uses JSON as its basic serialization, with a preprocessing step to support non-JSON types.

Why not a binary format? While the author is a big fan of optimized binary protocols in other contexts, it cannot be denied that in a browser, JSON has big advantages. Being built-in to the browser gives it a leg up in performance, code size, and developer tooling.

Non-JSON types are encoded using arrays. The first element of the array contains a string type code, and the remaining elements contain the parameters needed to construct that type. For example, a `Date` might be encoded as:

```
["date", 1749342170815]
```

To encode an array, the array must be wrapped in a second layer of array to create an array expression:

```
[["just", "an", "array"]]
```

## Client vs. Server

The protocol does not have a "client" or a "server"; it is fully bidirectional. Either side can call interfaces exported by the other.

With that said, for documentation purposes, we often use the words "client" and "server" when describing specific interactions, in order to make the language easier to understand. The word "client" generally refers to the caller of an RPC, or the importer of a stub. The word "server" refers to the callee, or the exporter. This is merely a convention to make explanations more natural.

## Transport and Framing

The protocol operates on a bidirectional stream of discrete messages. Each message is a single JSON value (typically an array). The protocol does not define how messages are framed on the wire; this is the responsibility of the transport layer.

For transports that natively provide message framing (e.g. WebSocket or MessagePort), each transport-level message corresponds to exactly one RPC message.

The built-in HTTP transport is newline-delimited, packing a series of messages into a single HTTP request or response body. Each message is serialized as a single line of JSON (no embedded newlines), and messages are separated by a newline character (`\n`). An empty body is interpreted as zero messages.

Other transports are free to use other framing strategies.

## Imports and Exports

Each side of an RPC session maintains two tables: imports and exports. One side's exports correspond to the other side's imports. Imports and exports are assigned sequential numeric IDs. However, in some cases an ID needs to be chosen by the importing side, and in some cases by the exporting side. In order to avoid conflicts:

* When the importing side chooses the ID, it chooses the next positive ID (starting from 1 and going up).
* When the exporting side chooses the ID, it chooses the next negative ID (starting from -1 and going down).
* ID zero is automatically assigned to the "main" interface.

To be more specific:

* The importing side chooses the ID when it initiates a call: the ID represents the result of the call.
* The exporting side chooses the ID when it sends a message containing a stub: the ID represents the target of the stub.

For comparison, in CapTP and Cap'n Proto, there are four tables instead of two: imports, exports, questions, and answers. In this library, we have unified questions with imports, and answers with exports.

By convention, when describing the meaning of any RPC message, we always take the perspective of the sender. So, if a message contains an "import ID", it is an import from the perspective of the sender, and an export from the perspective of the recipient.

Note that IDs are never reused. This differs from Cap'n Proto, which always tries to choose the smallest available ID. We assume no session will ever exceed 2^53 IDs, so simply assigning sequentially should be fine.

## Push and pull

An RPC call follows this sequence:

* The client sends the server a "push" message, containing an expression to evaluate.
    * The "push" message is implicitly assigned the next positive ID in the client's import table.
    * The expression expresses the call to make.
    * Upon receipt, the server evaluates the expression and delivers the call to the application.
* The client subsequently sends the server a "pull" message, specifying the import ID just created by the "push". This expresses that the client is interested in receiving the result of the call as a "resolve" message.
* The client may subsequently refer to the import ID in pipelined requests.
* When the server is done executing the call, it sends a "resolve" message, specifying the export ID of the "push" and an expression for its result.
* Upon receiving the resolution, the client no longer needs the import table entry, so sends a "release" message.
    * Upon receipt, the server disposes its copy of the return value, if necessary.

Some notes:

* The client does not need to send a "pull" message if it doesn't care to receive the results. In practice, if the application never awaits the promise, then it is never pulled. The promise can still be used in pipelining without pulling.
* Technically, the pushed expression can contain any number of calls, including none. A client could, for example, push a large data structure containing no calls, and then subsequently make multiple calls that use this data structure via "pipelining", to avoid having to send the same data multiple times.
* If the call throws an exception, the server will send a "reject" message instead of "resolve".
* "resolve" and "reject" are the same messages used to resolve exported promises, that is, a promise that was introduced when it was sent as part of some other RPC message. Thus, calls and exported promises work the same. This differs from Cap'n Proto, where returning from a call and resolving an exported promise were entirely different messages (with a lot of duplicated semantics).

## Top-level RPC Messages

The following are the top-level messages that can be sent over the RPC transport.

`["push", expression]`

Asks the recipient to evaluate the given expression. The expression is implicitly assigned the next sequential import ID (in the positive direction). The recipient will evaluate the expression, delivering any calls therein to the application. The final result can be pulled, or used in promise pipelining.

`["pull", importId]`

Signals that the sender would like to receive a "resolve" message for the resolution of the given import, which must refer to a promise. This is normally only used for imports created by a "push", as exported promises are pulled automatically.

`["resolve", exportId, expression]`

Instructs the recipient to evaluate the given expression and then use it as the resolution of the given promise export.

`["reject", exportId, expression]`

Instructs the recipient to evaluate the given expression and then use it to reject the given promise export. The expression is not permitted to contain stubs. It typically evaluates to an `Error`, although technically JavaScript does not require that thrown values are `Error`s.

`["release", importId, refcount]`

Instructs the recipient to release the given entry in the import table, disposing whatever it is connected to. If the import is a promise, the recipient is no longer obliged to send a "resolve" message for it, though it is still permitted to do so.

`refcount` is the total number of times this import ID has been "introduced", i.e. the number of times it has been the subject of an "export" or "promise" expression, plus 1 if it was created by a "push". The refcount must be sent to avoid a race condition if the receiving side has recently exported the same ID again. The exporter remembers how many times they have exported this ID, decrementing it by the refcount of any release messages received, and only actually releases the ID when this count reaches zero.

`["stream", expression]`

Like `["push", expression]`, asks the recipient to evaluate the given expression. The expression is implicitly assigned the next sequential import ID (in the positive direction). However, unlike "push":

* Promise pipelining on the result is not supported. The caller must not refer to the import ID in subsequent expressions.
* The expression is automatically considered "pulled". The sender does not need to send a separate "pull" message.
* Once the recipient sends a "resolve" or "reject" message for the expression's result, the export is implicitly released (with a refcount of 1). The sender does not need to send a separate "release" message.

This message type is designed for streaming writes, where the result is expected to be empty, and the overhead of separate "pull" and "release" messages is high.

`["pipe"]`

Creates a "pipe" on the remote end. A pipe consists of a `ReadableStream` end and a `WritableStream` end. The pipe is implicitly assigned the next sequential import ID (in the positive direction), similar to `["push", expression]`.

The new import is not a promise. It is immediately usable as if it were a `WritableStream` — the sender can call `write`, `close`, and/or `abort` on it, using the same interface as described for the `["writable", exportId]` expression.

The readable end of the pipe can be referenced in a subsequent message using the `["readable", importId]` expression. This expression can only be used once per pipe.

The purpose of the pipe mechanism is to support sending `ReadableStream` over RPC. When a message contains a `ReadableStream`, the sender first sends a `["pipe"]` message to establish the writable end, then begins pumping the stream's data through it (by calling `write`, `close`, `abort`), and includes the readable end in the subsequent message via `["readable", importId]`. This allows data to start flowing immediately without waiting for a network round trip.

`["abort", expression]`

Indicates that the sender has experienced an error causing it to terminate the session. The expression evaluates to the error which caused the abort. No further messages will be sent nor received.

## Expressions

Expressions are JSON-serializable object trees. All JSON types except arrays are interpreted literally. Arrays are further evaluated into a final value as follows.

`[[...]]`

An array expression. The inner array contains expressions (one for each array element), which are individually evaluated to produce the final array value.

For example, this expression represents an object containing an array:

```
{
  "key": [[
    "abc",
    ["date", 1757214689123],
    [[0]]
  ]]
}
```

This is an expression which will evaluate to an object. The expression representing the value of the "key" field is an array expression.
- The 1st item in the array expression is an expression for the string "abc"
- The 2nd item is an expression for a date object
- The 3rd item is another array expression containing an integer expression representing zero.

This expression will evaluate to the following object:
```
{
  "key": [
    "abc",
    Date(1757214689123),
    [0]
  ]
}
```

`["undefined"]`

The literal value `undefined`.

`["inf"]`, `["-inf"]`, `["nan"]`

The values Infinity, -Infinity, and NaN.

`["bytes", base64]`

A `Uint8Array`, represented as a base64-encoded string.

`["blob", type, readableExpression]`

A `Blob` value. `type` is the MIME type string (`blob.type`), which may be an empty string. `readableExpression` is an expression that evaluates to a `ReadableStream` carrying the blob's bytes; in practice, the encoder always uses a `["readable", importId]` expression backed by a pipe. Because reading a `Blob`'s bytes is inherently asynchronous, the pipe path is always used — there is no inline fast path even for small blobs. The receiver must collect all chunks from the stream before delivering the value to application code.

`["bigint", decimal]`

A bigint value, represented as a decimal string.

`["date", number]`

A JavaScript `Date` value. The number represents milliseconds since the Unix epoch.

`["error", type, message, stack?, props?]`

A JavaScript `Error` value. `type` is the name of the specific well-known `Error` subclass, e.g. "TypeError". `message` is a string containing the error message. `stack` may optionally contain the stack trace, though by default stacks will be redacted for security reasons.

`props` is an optional fifth element carrying any extra data attached to the error. It is a JSON object whose keys are the error's own enumerable properties (plus the standard non-enumerable `cause` slot, and `errors` for `AggregateError`), and whose values are themselves valid expressions of this protocol round-trip naturally. Property values that cannot be represented are silently dropped from `props`; the error itself always reaches the receiver.

When `props` is present, `stack` is normalised to `null` if absent so that positional indexing for `props` is unambiguous. When there are no extras, the legacy 3- or 4-element form is emitted unchanged.

`["headers", pairs]`

A `Headers` object from the Fetch API. `pairs` is an array of `[name, value]` pairs, where both `name` and `value` are strings. For example: `["headers", [["content-type", "text/plain"], ["x-custom", "hello"]]]`.

`["request", url, init]`

A `Request` object from the Fetch API. `url` and `init` are the parameters to pass to `Request`'s constructor to create the desired `Request` instance. The sender should omit properties from `init` when their value would be the default value anyway. `init.headers`, if present, must contain an array of pairs, suitable to pass to the constructor of `Headers`. `init.body`, if present, is an expression for the response body, which must evaluate to `null`, a string, `Uint8Array`, or `ReadableStream`. Other properties of `init` must be plain values; they will not be evaluated as expressions before passing to the `Request` constructor.

At this time, `init.signal` is not supported and must not be sent, though that will change when `AbortSignal` gains support for serialization.

`["response", body, init]`

A `Response` object from the Fetch API. `body` and `init` are the parameters to pass to `Response`'s constructor to create the desired `Response` instance. `body` is an expression which must evaluate to `null`, a string, `UInt8Array`, or `ReadableStream`. `init.headers`, if present, must contain an array of pairs, suitable to pass to the constructor of `Headers`. Other properties of `init`, except for `webSocket` (below), must be plain values; they will not be evaluated as expressions before passing to the `Response` constructor.

`init.webSocket` is sent when the `Response` has a `webSocket` property -- a Cloudflare Workers extension indicating a response that completed an HTTP/WebSocket upgrade. (Bare `WebSocket` objects, outside of an upgrade `Response`, are not serializable.) When it is present, `body` is always `null` and `init` never contains `status` nor `statusText`: the upgrade itself implies status 101, though a receiver whose `Response` constructor cannot represent 1xx statuses may substitute a default status.

`init.webSocket` is an object of the form `{"readable": <expression>, "writable": <expression>}`, representing the socket as a pair of streams. `readable` evaluates to a `ReadableStream` carrying the messages arriving on the sender's socket; `writable` evaluates to a `WritableStream` carrying messages to send on it. Both use the regular stream serialization (and thus inherit its flow control), so the sender begins streaming the socket's messages immediately upon serializing the `Response`, before the receiver has even learned of the socket's existence.

Each chunk on either stream is a message: a string for a text frame, or a `Uint8Array` for a binary frame. Additionally, a chunk of the form `{"close": {"code": <number>, "reason": <string>}}` conveys closure of the socket, and is the last chunk before the stream ends. A stream that ends without a close chunk indicates the socket closed without a status (as if code 1005); a stream that is aborted indicates the socket failed. Canceling the readable or aborting the writable tells the sender to close the socket; in particular, a receiver whose application never uses the socket should cancel and release both streams so the sender can close the connection.

`["import", importId, propertyPath, callArguments]`
`["pipeline", importId, propertyPath, callArguments]`

References an entry on the import table (from the perspective of the sender), possibly performing actions on it.

If the type is "import", the expression evaluates to a stub. If it is "pipeline", the expression evaluates to a promise. The difference is important because promises must be replaced with their resolution before delivering the message to the application, whereas stubs will be delivered as stubs without waiting for any resolution.

`propertyPath` is optional. If specified, it is an array of property names (strings or numbers) leading to a specific property of the import's target. The expression evaluates to that property (unless `callArguments` is also specified).

`callArguments` is also optional. If specified, then the given property should be called as a function. `callArguments` is an array of expressions; these expressions are evaluated to produce the arguments to the call.

`["remap", importId, propertyPath, captures, instructions]`

Implements the `.map()` operation. (We call this "remap" so as not to confuse with the serialization of a `Map` object.)

`importId` and `propertyPath` are the same as for the `"import"` operation. These identify the particular property which is to be mapped.

`captures` and `instructions` define the mapper function which is to apply to the target value.

`captures` defines the set of stubs which the mapper function has captured, in the sense of a lambda capture. The body of the function may call these stubs. The format of `captures` is an array, where each member of the array is either `["import", importId]` or `["export", exportId]`, which refer to an entry on the (sender's) import or export table, respectively.

`instructions` contains a list of expressions which should be evaluated to execute the mapper function on a particular input value. Each instruction is an expression in the same format described in this doc, but with special handling of imports and exports. For the purpose of the instructions in a mapper, there is no export table. The import table, meanwhile, is defined as follows:
* Negative values refer to the `captures` list, starting from -1. So, -1 is `captures[0]`, -2 is `captures[1]`, and so on.
* Zero refers to the input value of the map function.
* Positive values refer to the results of previous instructions, starting from 1. So, 1 is the result of evaluating `instructions[0]`, 2 is the result of evaluating `instructions[1]`, and so on.

The instructions are always evaluated in order. Each instruction may only import results of instructions that came before it. The last instruction evaluates to the return value of the map function.

`["export", exportId]`

The sender is exporting a new stub (or re-exporting a stub that was exported before). The expression evaluates to a stub.

`["promise", exportId]`

Like "export", but the expression evaluates to a promise. Promises must be replaced with their resolution before the message is finally delivered to the application.

The `exportId` in this case is always a newly-allocated ID. The sender will proactively send a "resolve" (or "reject") message for this ID when the promise resolves (unless it is released first). The recipient does not need to "pull" the promise explicitly; it is assumed that the recipient always wants the resolution.

`["writable", exportId]`

Represents a `WritableStream`. The sender has called `getWriter()` on the stream, locking it, and holds the writer to handle incoming operations. The `exportId` refers to an entry on the export table that accepts the following method calls:

- `write(chunk)` - Write a chunk to the stream. The chunk can be any RPC-compatible value.
- `close()` - Close the stream normally, indicating all data has been written.
- `abort(reason?)` - Abort the stream with an optional reason.

These methods correspond to the methods of `WritableStreamDefaultWriter`.

If the export is released without `close()` having been called, the sender will abort the stream, indicating an abnormal termination (e.g., network disconnect).

The receiver does not need to wait for each `write()` call to complete before sending the next one, nor before sending `close()`. The sender will process writes in order. The receiver should wait for `close()` to complete to verify that all writes were successful; if any write failed, `close()` will also fail with that error.

`["readable", importId]`

References the readable end of a pipe previously created by a `["pipe"]` message. `importId` must refer to an import table entry that was created as a pipe. The expression evaluates to a `ReadableStream`.

This expression can only be used once per pipe. Once the readable end has been retrieved, it is removed from the pipe entry.

See the description of `["pipe"]` in the top-level messages section for an explanation of how pipes and readable streams work together.
